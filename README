Create a banking application with an HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend and a Java backend that accomplishes the same functionality as P0. 
Your backend can follow several different architecture types, including RESTful and monolithic.

Customers of the bank should be able to register with a username and password, and apply to open an account. 
Once the account is open, customers should be able to withdraw, deposit, and transfer funds between accounts 
Employees of the bank should be able to view all of their customers information Employees should be able to approve/deny open applications for accounts 
Every Java class should have at least one unit test Logging should be accomplished using Log4J All user interactions should be via a frontend 
made in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript All information should be persisted using AJAX requests to initiate database operations
